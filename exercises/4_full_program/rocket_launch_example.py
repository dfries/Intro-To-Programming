'''
This file is a rocket launch program that will be developed over
the remaining exercises. It will use the Sense HAT as both an input
and an output device. It will display and launch a virtual rocket.

In this file we will do:
 - Exercise 4 - Read input for environmental conditions
 - Exercise 5 - Use conditional logic (if/else) to verify env conditions
 - Exercise 6 - Create a for loop for the rocket countdown and output
                the countdown to the SenseHAT
 - Exercise 7 - Use functions to launch our rocket
